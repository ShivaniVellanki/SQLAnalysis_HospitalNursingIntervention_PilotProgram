# SQLAnalysis_HospitalNursingIntervention_PilotProgram
Analyzing hospital nursing interventions using SQL, the project examines bed types, utilization, and business aspects through a star schema. It aims to optimize bed planning and identify pilot program candidates.

The project focuses on analyzing a hospital's nursing intervention pilot program through SQL analysis, utilizing a database comprising three tables: bed_type, bed_fact, and business. By structuring these tables within a star schema, the project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis and interpretation of various bed-related metrics, such as licensed, census, and staffed beds, across different hospital businesses and bed types. This analytical approach allows for the exploration of dimensions and facts to understand better and optimize hospital bed utilization and planning strategies.

The aim is to assess and recommend potential hospitals for piloting nursing interventions based on detailed metrics, including the availability and usage of licensed, census, and staffed beds. Inputs include quantitative and descriptive data from the bed_type, bed_fact, and business tables, encompassing bed counts and business entity information. The outputs are insightful analyses identifying trends and capacities across hospitals, leading to tailored recommendations for pilot program implementation. These recommendations consider hospital capacities, bed utilization rates, and infrastructure, offering a strategic approach to enhancing patient care and hospital efficiency through targeted nursing interventions.
